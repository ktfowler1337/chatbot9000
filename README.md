## 🔧 API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/chat` - Send message to AI
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check

## Considerations

## How would you test your agent and interface, what are the different failure scenarios, and what tools or methods would you use to manage them?

### Testing
- Unit Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library for components
- Integration Tests: API endpoint testing with FastAPI TestClient  
- E2E Tests: Playwright for user workflow validation, including snapshot tests for visual verification
- Type Safety: 100% TypeScript coverage with strict mode

### Failure Scenarios
- API Failures: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Network Issues: Offline detection with graceful degradation
- Invalid Input: Client-side validation with error boundaries
- Storage Limits: localStorage quota monitoring and cleanup
- AI Rate Limits: Request queuing and user feedback

### Testing Tools
- Frontend: Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW (mocking)
- Backend: pytest, httpx for async testing
- Monitoring: Error boundaries, console error tracking
- Performance: Lighthouse CI, bundle analysis

## What are the security considerations of your project and what are potential ways to defend against them?

### Current Security Measures
- API Key Protection: Server-side API key storage only
- Input Validation: Strict message validation (length, content)
- XSS Prevention: Material-UI sanitized components
- CORS Configuration: Restricted origins for API access
- No Sensitive Storage: No user credentials in localStorage

### Security Threats & Defenses
- API Key Exposure: Backend proxy prevents client exposure
- XSS Attacks: React's built-in XSS protection + Content Security Policy
- Injection Attacks: Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- Data Privacy: No server-side user data storage
- Rate Limiting: TODO: Implement backend rate limiting per IP

### Recommended Security Enhancements
```typescript
// Future security implementations
- JWT authentication for user sessions
- Request rate limiting (Redis-based)
- Input sanitization library (DOMPurify)
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Security headers (helmet middleware)
```

## What are the performance concerns for your project, how will it scale in throughout, response times, and supported tasks?

### Current Performance
- Bundle Size: 606KB (192KB gzipped) - optimized with tree shaking
- Load Time: <2s initial load, <100ms subsequent navigation
- Memory Usage: ~50MB RAM for typical conversation
- API Response: 1-3s depending on AI model response time

### Scaling Considerations

#### Throughput Scaling
- Frontend: Static hosting scales infinitely (CDN)
- Backend: Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- Bottleneck: Google AI API rate limits (60 RPM default)
- Solution: Request queuing, multiple API keys, caching

#### Response Time Optimization
- Current: 1-3s per AI response
- Optimizations: 
  - Streaming responses for immediate feedback
  - Response caching for similar queries
  - Optimistic UI updates

#### Supported Tasks
- Current Limit: ~100 concurrent conversations (localStorage)
- Backend Limit: Depends on server resources (currently unlimited)
- AI Model Limit: Context window ~1M tokens per conversation

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Built-in monitoring points
- Bundle size analysis (webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- API response times (TanStack Query DevTools)
- Memory usage tracking (React DevTools Profiler)
- localStorage usage monitoring
```

## What caveats should be documented or gotchas?

### Known Limitations
- localStorage Limit: ~5-10MB browser storage limit
- No User Accounts: Conversations lost when clearing browser data
- Single Device: No cross-device synchronization
- AI Dependencies: Relies on Google AI service availability
- No Real-time: No WebSocket for live collaboration features

### Development Gotchas
```typescript
// Common issues and solutions
1. API Key Missing: Check environment variables
3. localStorage Full: Implement conversation cleanup
```

## If you had more time, what would you do differently, and how would you expand the functionality?

Admittedly I did quite a bit more than was asked.  This code needs a lot more reviewing and refactoring to cleanup what the AI (Claude Sonnet 4) generated.
The code itself is not up to my personal standards, but it is functional and a pretty cool POC overall. 

### Refactoring/TODOs I deem out of scope for now
- Add playwright tests
- decrease prop drilling as result of coupling of the large useConversationManager hook
- leverage something like useLocalStorage from useHooks package, or something like that to decrease custom spun code on the persistence side
- revisit unit tests, they are purely auto-generated right now.  Likely some oddities in there.
- backend was auto-gen, have not reviewed or touched it.  It "just works" right now, and this is mostly a frontend showcase I'm okay with that
- revisit error handling

### With More Time
- Theme: Ability to swap light/darkmode
- Branding: Customized MUI theming or some other sort of design system
- Internationalization: Allow the user to swap languages
- Api Client: Use an auto-generated api client instead of custom queries
- Component library: Build more shared components to increase code reusability
- Authentication System: User accounts with cloud sync
- Advanced AI: Multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Mobile Apps: React Native with shared business logic
- Enterprise Features: SSO, audit logs, admin panel
- Error reporting / tracking

### Architectural Improvements
- Backend Database: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Microservices: Separate auth, chat, and AI services
- Event Sourcing: Audit trail for all user actions
- Caching Layer: Redis for session and response caching
- Message Queue: Background processing for AI requests

### Performance Enhancements
- CDN Integration: Global content delivery
- Service Workers: Offline functionality and caching
- Database Indexing: Optimized queries for large datasets
- Load Balancing: Multiple backend instances
- Streaming Responses: Real-time AI response streaming

## What kind of user interface and/or developer experience improvements would you make to this project?

### User Interface
- Voice Input: Speech-to-text integration
- Rich Text: Markdown rendering and code highlighting
- File Uploads: Image and document sharing
- Themes: Multiple UI themes and customization
- Mobile Optimization: Touch-friendly responsive design

### Developer Experience
- API Documentation: Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- Development Tools: Better debugging and profiling
- Testing Utils: Component testing utilities
- CLI Tools: Project scaffolding and deployment scripts
- IDE Integration: VS Code extensions and snippets
- CI/CD pipeline: see ci.yml and github config.  main is protected and can't merge with tests and coverage passing

### Accessibility
- Screen Reader: Full ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- High Contrast: Accessibility-compliant color schemes  
- Font Scaling: Responsive typography for visual impairments
- Voice Navigation: Voice control integration
